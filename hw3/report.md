Introduction
This research was aimed at clarifying the phylogenetic (state) of ... in turtles' family and the difference of impact of gene markers.

Methods
Samples for 9 species of turtles were accessed from Genbank. Alligator missipiensis was chosen as outgroup. Four gene markers were chosen: 12S, 16S, COI and RAG-1.
As there were several sequences for the same gene marker and species, consensus sequences were made for them and aligned with MAFFT for each gene marker. Then, supermatrix of concatenated genes was built with AMAS.
Both separate gene markes and concatened supermatrix were used as data, as well as all sequences ungrouped.
Several trees were built with different approaches and visualized with ITOL: neighbor-joining with phylip, maximum likelihood with IQTree and Bayesian with MrBayes.

Results
There were significant differences in inferred phylogenetic relationships between species when using different markers. 
For ML approach, the most reliable bootstrap support values were found for 12S gene, others had weak support.

As for NJ trees, the 12S tree is consistant with ML one, whereas others also have weak support and negative branch length values.

The tree with all sequences was also made to check some of the reasons for weak support:
